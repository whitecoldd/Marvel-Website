Hello, Mr. Csonka László!
I want to warn you in advance that  my DELETE and UPDATE functions work only for last added data, and also for some reason UPDATE button could work wrong for some users.
I was checking how it works with my friend to be sure that it won't fail working when I will send it to you, but in some cases we got the SQL error.
It was saying that we can't SELECT and UPDATE at the same time, I was trying to fix it but it caused more problems than before so I left it like this, at least it works on my PC.


P.S. unpack the folder "marvel website" itself in your htdocs but not the content inside. 

Buiucli Vladimir.
